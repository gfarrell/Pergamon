# Pergamon

Pergamon is home library software for those homes that have enough books that most desktop-based solutions like Delicious Library just aren't viable, but aren't lending libraries and so most of the small library software out there just doesn't fit the bill either. Pergamon is designed to run on a web-server, and to be light enough that it will run on something small like a Raspberry Pi or Sheeva Plug (since most households probably don't need to run a full scale server). It can also be run pretty easily on a small cloud instance.

Pergamon is built with Laravel (PHP) as the server-side.
